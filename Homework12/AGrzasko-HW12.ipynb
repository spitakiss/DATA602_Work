There are many ways you can go about doing this, and I'm not looking for anything too complicated.  If you can get multiple processes crunching the data together, that is great.  Using IPython’s built-in tools would be a great method."

The amount you see will largely be based the capabilities of your hardware, and less on the software implementation.  There is additional overhead for running an operation in parallel, so speed gains will be more obvious with a larger number of calculations."
